## Assignments
### Assignment 1 - Predator
Pete (the circle) exists in a world of two zones. A Predator (the triangle) also lives in the same world, and constantly wants to get at Pete and destroy him. Pete is a little dumb and runs around all over the place randomly, implementing a Perlin noise walk. Meanwhile, the Predator is attracted (in terms of force, not in terms of love) to Pete and is constantly accelerating toward him. However, the Predator goes a bit crazier when in the red zone, and a bit milder when in the green zone.

Pete becomes bigger each time he is poked by the Predator. If he gets too big, he will explode and die.
